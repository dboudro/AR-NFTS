## What is the Roots Network?
The Roots Network is an informationally dense, no bs system for organizing, saving, and sharing hyperlinks. The goal is to share great value in the simplest form.


## Why is the Roots Network Important?
The hyperlink is a fundamental concept of the internet.  Therefore the organization of hyperlinks is essential to a healthy and productive internet--which is why websites such as Google and Reddit have become massively high value portals to the information available on the web. Roots Network is an informationally dense and typographically designed system for sharing the essence of value and information; a brutalist organization of hyperlinks.  Instagram has popularized the sharing of images, Roots will popularize the advanced organization, saving, and communication of hyperlinks to high value content.

Brian Norgard, The "architect of the top grossing app in the world", ![tweeted](https://twitter.com/BrianNorgard/status/1112760508510199808) that feeds are dead and private/group communication will be the next communication paradigm.  Roots Network supports this paradigm of high value private communication of value via hyperlinks.
